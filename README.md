This is a portfolio project constructed without starter code to showcase work I have already created and will create throughout my time in the MSU bootcamp.
I used a combination of html and css to create a unique website to display my work for potential employers to access and evaluate. Currently only two projects are featured but as class progresses I have plenty of room to add more as I need to. A potential employer can view my work, look at my resume and use the contact information in the portfolio to contact me.
