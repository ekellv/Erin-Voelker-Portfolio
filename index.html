            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me-content">I'm currently a receiving expert at Target. My responsibilities include accurately counting and auditing vendor orders as well as maintaining brand expectations of a busy backroom space. Through Target and Guild Education, I am able to have the opportunity to attend the Michigan State University Coding Bootcamp. This six-month program will give me the education I need to jumpstart a career in the ever expanding field of information technology.
                <br><br>
                I was born and raised in New Jersey, and have eaten many Taylor Ham, egg and cheese on a hard roll (with salt, pepper and ketchup, of course) for breakfast. My hobbies include reading, video games, and sewing; a hobby I picked up during the ides of 2020.
